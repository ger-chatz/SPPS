#  Comparative Statistical Analysis of Surgical Techniques: Greece vs Germany

##  Project Overview

This project presents a **clinical statistical analysis** conducted as part of a collaborative medical research study between myself (statistical researcher) and a practicing doctor.  
The goal was to compare the **surgical outcomes** of two different surgical teams — one in **Greece** and one in **Germany** — across multiple preoperative and postoperative variables.

All aspects of the **data collection, statistical testing, and interpretation** were handled by me using **SPSS 25**.

##  Role and Contribution

- Led the **entire statistical research process**, in coordination with a physician.
- Designed the analysis plan, selected appropriate tests based on data distribution and sample size.
- Executed data preparation, hypothesis testing, and reporting using **non-parametric methods**.
- Created all result tables, interpretations, and statistical justifications.
- Co-authored the final medical report for publication.

##  Objective

To assess whether statistically significant differences exist between the two surgical groups (Greek and German patients), in terms of:

- Preoperative characteristics (e.g. age, BMI, PADUA, ASA, preoperative eGFR)
- Postoperative outcomes (e.g. Hb drop, operative time, ischemia time, complications)

##  Methodology

- **Sample Size**: 30 patients (n = 15 per group)
- **Statistical Tool**: SPSS 25
- **Tests Used**:
  - Mann–Whitney U Test for non-parametric comparisons of quantitative data
  - Chi-Square Test and Fisher’s Exact Test for categorical variables
- **Variables Assessed**:
  - Preoperative: Age, BMI, PADUA Score, ASA Score, Preoperative Hb & eGFR
  - Postoperative: Operative Time, Hospital Stay, Ischemia Time, Surgical Margins, Clavien System grading, Hb 10 Hours Post-op, eGFR changes
